* Prequel: why distributions?

- Statistics are derived from experimental observations, which form
  values of variables stored in column vectors of data frames

- As soon as you observe 1 value, you have a /distribution/. The more
  values, the more interesting the distribution (for classification)

- Example: a "normal" distribution (also Gaussian or Bell curve)
  #+caption: Bell curve with sample mean and standard deviation
  [[../img/5_normal.png]]

- This can be reproduced in R with pseudo-random numbers from ~rnorm~.
  #+begin_src R :session *R* :exports both :results output graphics file :file ../img/5_binom.png
    par(mfrow=c(2,1))
    hist(rnorm(1e+05))
    plot(density(rnorm(1e+05)))
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:../img/5_binom.png]]

- The distribution as a pattern exhibits measures of centrality (like
  \mu), and measures of spread (like \sigma).

* Quantiles, percentiles and five-number-summary

- A /quantile/ is a value that characterizes a distribution: it
  characterizes the rank of an observation

- The /median/ or middle magnitude is the 0.5th quantile: half of all
  measurements lie below (and above) it
  #+begin_src R :session *R* :exports both :results output graphics file :file ../img/5_median.png
    plot(density(chickwts$weight))
    abline(v=median(chickwts$weight), col="red")
    abline(v=mean(chickwts$weight), col="blue")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:../img/5_median.png]]

- Quantiles can be expressed as /percentiles/, on a scale of [0,100]
  instead of [0,1]: the p-th quantile is the 100*p-th percentile

- All algorithms to identify quantiles/percentiles sort observations,
  and then compute a weighted average to find p numerically

* Quantiles by hand

Do it by hand! What is the 0th / 0.25th / 0.5th / .75th and 1th
quantile of ~foo <- c(100, 498.5, 22, 0, -33, 100.66, -2)~
#+begin_src R
  foo <- c(100, 498.5, 22, 0, -33, 100.66, -2)
  foo
#+end_src
1) Which number is smaller than any other (0th quantile/percentile -
   0 numbers lie below it). *Minimum of the data*.
   #+begin_src R
     min(foo)
   #+end_src
2) The 25th percentile splits off the lowest 25% from the highest
   75%. This number is the middle number between the smallest number
   (minimum, 0th quantile) and the median (0.5th quantile), or the
   *median of the lower half of the data*.
   #+begin_src R
     foo_s <- sort(foo)  # sort vector from smallest to largest
     foo_s
     median(foo_s) # compute median: (-2+1)/2 = -1
     median(c(-33,-2,0,22)) # 1st quartile
   #+end_src
3) The 0.5th quartile or 50th percentile: half of the values are
   smaller than it - *median of the data*.
   #+begin_src R
     median(foo)
   #+end_src
4) The 0.75th quartile or 75% percentile: 3/4 of all values are
   smaller than it. This number is the middle number between the
   largest number (maximum), or the *median of the upper half of the
   data*.
   #+begin_src R
     foo_s <- sort(foo)  # sort vector from smallest to largest
     foo_s
     median(foo_s) # compute median: (-2+1)/2 = -1
     median(c(22,100,100.66,498.50)) # 3rd quartile
   #+end_src
5) The 1.00th quartile or 100% percentile: all values are smaller than
   it. This number is the *maximum value of the data*.
   #+begin_src R
     max(foo)
   #+end_src
   Compare the result with the ~quantile~ algorithm:
   #+begin_src R
     q <- quantile(foo)
     names(q)<-NULL
     identical(q,c(-33,-1,22,100.33,498.5))
   #+end_src
   Quantiles with ~quantile~
- Using our old friend ~xdata <- c(2,4.4,3,3,2,2.2,2,4)~, we can use
  ~quantile~ to compute the 0th to 4th quantile.
  #+begin_src R
    xdata <- c(2,4.4,3,3,2,2.2,2,4)
    xdata
    sort(xdata)
    quantile(xdata)
  #+end_src
- With ~quantile~, we can also compute other quantiles, like the 0.8th
  quantile (or 80th percentile): 80% of all values are smaller than it:
  #+begin_src R
    quantile(xdata, prob=0.8)
  #+end_src
- [ ] Does ~quantile~ allow removing ~NA~ values?
  #+begin_src R
    quantile(c(xdata, NA), prob=0.8, na.rm=TRUE)
  #+end_src
- ~quantile~ is a generic function and can take multiple input formats
  #+begin_src R
    methods(quantile)
  #+end_src
- ~quantile~ can also handle probability vectors.
  #+begin_src R
    quantile(xdata, prob=c(0, .25, 0.75, 1))
  #+end_src
- [ ] What happens if you choose ~prob > 1~
  #+begin_src R
    quantile(xdata, prob=1.5)
  #+end_src
- ~quantile~ supports *nine* different algorithms. The ~help(quantile)~
  reveals that different statistical programming languages (S, SPSS,
  SAS) use different algorithms.
* Quantiles and summary with functions

- ~quantile(x,prob=c(0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1)~ is the 5-number summary
  consists of:
  1) the minimum (0th quantile/percentile) or minimum
  2) the 1st/lower quartile (0.25th quantile/25th percentile)
  3) the 2nd quartile or median (0.5th quantile/50th percentile)
  4) the 3rd or upper quartile (0.75th quantile/75th percentile)
  5) the 4th quartile (1st quantile/100th percentile) or maximum

- This summary is also computed by ~summary~
  #+begin_src R
    summary(xdata)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  :    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
  :   2.000   2.000   2.600   2.825   3.250   4.400

* TODO Practice: quantiles

1) Compute the lower and upper quartiles of the weights of the chicks
   in the built-in ~chickwts~ data frame.
   #+begin_src R
     quantile(chickwts$weight, prob=c(0.25,0.75))
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   :   25%   75%
   : 204.5 323.5

2) What do these results mean?
   #+begin_quote
   25% of the chicks weights lie at or below 204.5 grams, and 75% of
   the chick weights lie at or below 323.5 grams.
   #+end_quote

3) Compute the five-number summary and the sample mean of the
   magnitude of the seismic events off the coast of Fiji that occurred
   at a depth of less than 400 km, using the built-in ~quakes~ data
   frame.
   #+begin_src R
     summary(quakes$mag[quakes$depth<400])
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   :    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
   :    4.00    4.40    4.60    4.67    4.90    6.40

4) What do these results mean?
   #+begin_quote
   Most of the quakes below that depth of 400km lie around 4.6 on the
   Richter scale. The maximum is much further away from the upper
   quartile than the minimum is from the lower quartile. This suggests
   that the distribution of quake magnitude vs. depth is skewed. More
   specifically, it's skewed to the right - i.e. it stretches out more
   positively from the center to the right. The mean is dragged up by
   this skewedness. 
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output graphics file :file ../img/5_quakebox.png
     index <- quakes$depth<400
     y <- quakes$mag[index]
     boxplot(y,
             data=quakes,
             xlab="Magnitude on the Richter scale",
             main="Quakes < 400 km depth",
             horizontal=TRUE)
        #+end_src
   
   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:../img/5_quakebox.png]]
   #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output graphics file :file ../img/5_quakehist.png
     hist(y,
          main="Quakes < 400 km depth",
          xlab="Magnitude on the Richter scale")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
