- How did people in antiquity experience and view the world?[fn:1]
- How did people in the middle ages experience and view the world?
- How do we in the modern age experience and view the world?
- What does this have to do with statistics and probability?

The essay '[[https://www.amazon.com/End-Modern-World-Romano-Guardini/dp/1882926587][The End of the Modern World]]' by Romano Guardini gave me the
idea for this section. It was born out of the thought that probability
as the foundation of statistics, is a profoundly *modern* concept, and I
was wondering if a brief historical, non-technical, philosophical
journey might help us orient ourselves towards it.

Guardini's book will appear pessimistic to non-faithful readers. It
was however, written to help people in Germany right after WW II get a
sense of purpose and orientation that they had lost after 12 years of
life under the Nazis.

The book is strangely prophetic in many ways - probably because it was
quite clear around the middle of the 20th century, what the essence of
modernity was, and where the journey would lead us in the 21st
century.

I'm offering this section to you because the DSC 482 classes should also
have a "senior spirit" of discourse and critical discussion, which one
cannot get from topical (in this case: statistics) textbooks alone.

base of this altar from a temple for Zeus is a relief showing the
battle between the Giants and the Olympian gods
("Gigantomachy"). Excavated by the German engineer Carl Humann
1878-1886, this is at the heart of the Pergamon-Museum in Berlin. This
altar stood in the ancient city of Troy (of Homer's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad][Iliad]]).

* SUMMARY
#+attr_html: :width 700px
#+caption: Jacques-Louis David - Death of Socrates (1787)
[[../img/2_socrates.jpg]]

1. From Ancient Greece, ca. 400 BC to the End of Rome, ca. 476 AD
2. Socrates & Plato (philosophy), Aristotle (physics), Euclid (maths)
3. The world is a (closed) ball or sphere within which the Gods live
   with us; man must search for truth and experiment with hypotheses.

#+begin_notes
/Image: David, Death of Socrates (1787)./ The Greek philosopher and
distinguished veteran of the Peloponnesian war, Socrates (469-399 BC),
was convicted of impiety by the Athenian court. Instead of renouncing
his beliefs, he died willingly, discoursing on the immortality of the
soul before drinking poisonous hemlock.

Guardini: "Classical man never went beyond his world; his feeling for
life, his imagination and his vision of existence were one with the
limited world he knew. He never asked himself whether or not something
might exist beyond his known world [...] because he lacked any
relation which could transcend his world."

"Classical man /could not even conceive/ of a desire to break the limits
of his world. To do so those limits must have already been
broken. This was simply not the case."[fn:2]

This implies the impossibility of thinking up a concept like
'probability'. However, classical man had mathematics as defined by
Wigner (1960): /"Mathematics is the science of skillful operations with
concepts and rules invented just for this purpose./ Euclid's elements
are an example, and his geometry was enough for Aristotle to explain
many natural phenomena (though the classical concept of "nature" has
got nothing to do with our modern idea of "nature")[fn:3]:

"Greek scientific thought was marked by flexbility and absence of
dogmatism. The Greek mind was gripped by an endless quest for
understanding of the ways of the world. Nothing however, had been
decided conclusively; every question remained open, waiting to be
answered further. Every philosophical reflection might contain the
answer to life; therefore it could compete with any other possible
supposition. Always, however, one had to remain within the limits laid
down by the fundamental ethos of the Greek world. These limits could
not be transgressed, and the trial of Socrates attest to the strnegth
of this prohibition."

Image: Annunciation of Cortona by Fra Angelico (1433). The scene
depicts the annunciation of Mary by the Archangel Gabriel. The words
in the painting can only be read upside-down to indicate that they are
addressed to God, who wold be in the proper position to read them.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortona][Cortona]], my own favorite place in Italy, is a small medieval town in
Tuscany - it was supposedly founded by one of Noah's sons, Crano, 273
years after the Great Flood. The city was already inhabited by
Etruscans at least since the 7th century BC. Lake Trasimeno where
Scipio the younger defeated Hannibal after he had crossed the Alps
with elephants, can be seen from Cortona. Next to the town is a small
convent, Le Celle, where St Francis of Assisi lived in a tiny cell.

"The crucial truth for medieval man was the fact of Divine Revelation
[...] set forth within the dogma of the Church [which] bound and
limited man by its authority; [but also] made it possible to surmount
this world. Revealed truth was conceptualized by means of a delicate
logic which distinguished and then united all of reality. The
theological system erect upon these foundations unfolded itself as a
great synthesis. In the modern sense of the term, however, scientific
explanation was almost unknown. The one point of departure for science
in the medieval intellectual synthesis was authority, that of
antiquity and especially the work of Aristotle" (384-322 BC), himself
a disciple of Plato's. "The Middle Ages had established a relationship
with antiquity which, although seemingly naive, was constructive."

"This drive for reconciliation [with antiquity] is crystallized in the
/Summae/, which united theology and philosophy, sociology and
morality. [...] Medieval man neither wished to explore the mysteries
of the world empirically nor did he want to illuminate them by a
rational methodology. He was interested in building his world out of
the content of Revelation and upon the principles and insights of
classical [Greek] philosophy. The /Summae/ are that world as it was
erected by the human mind. They can be compared with the medieval
cathedral in which every form and artifact [...] were given a symbolic
value which made possible a life and a sense of being integrally
religious in nature."

"What medieval man lacked was any desire for exact, empirical
knowledge of reality. [But] unless we free ourselves of the
evaluations made by the minds of the Renaissance and the
Enlightenment, we cannot really understand the Middle Ages. The
judgements then leveled were made under the pressure of a polemic,
which has succeeded in distorting the truth even to our own
day. Equally distorted was the glorified Middle Ages of the
Romantics."

"The Middle Ages were filled with a sense of religion, which was as
deep as it was rich, as strong as it was delicate, as firm in its
grasp of principles as it was original and fertile in their concrete
expression. From cloister and monastery there sone a religious light
whose strength cannot be overestimated. Medieval man thirsted for the
truth. [...] This passion for understanding, however, had nothing in
common with our modern enthusiasm for the techniques of scientific
investigation. Medieval man was interested neither in pursuing nature
and history empirically nor in mastering reality theoretically. He
chose to plunge into truth by way of meditation."

/Image:/ cross-section of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN,
Switzerland, where I spent a few good summers starting as a teenager,
working with physicists on photo multipliers, to my own PhD many years
later. I even met my wife there, at the first World-Wide Web
conference! - Particle accelerators like the LHC, and the data
processing surrounding a particle physics experiment are among the
greatest "big data" events you can think of: ALICE, one of the
detectors located in the cross-section shown above, has more than 12
billion sensors that create a data stream of more than 3.5 terabytes
per second, or 300 petabytes per day, which is more than the estimated
data created world-wide per day.

#+caption: Pablo Picasso, Guernica (1937), grayscale painting
[[../img/1_guernica.png]]

1. Renaissance (1500s); Enlightenment (1700s); Modernism (1900s)
2. Galileo (method), Newton (laws of motion), Einstein (relativity)
3. Man vs. machine; Earth vs. universe; Nature / Science vs. God

#+begin_notes
/Image:/ The grayscale painting "Guernica" by Picasso (1937) depics the bombing
on the Spanish city of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. It is
also a typical cubist-surrealist painting where reality is dissolved
in geometric patterns and symbols, distorted and disfigured to achieve
a heightened effect.

"[In the modern age,] man's passion for knowledge began to lead him
away from authority, pointing him directly toward real things.

“It is taken increasingly for granted that man ought to be treated as
an object. Man confronts this attitude in the range of authority
exercised over him; he may merely meet it in countless statistics and
tables or he may experience its culmination in an unspeakable rape of
the individual, of the group, even of the whole nation.”

* Footnotes

[fn:3]Wigner's 1960 paper is still worth reading. He writes about the
"miracle of appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the
formulation of the laws of physics," and admits that "we do not know
why our theories work so well." This is a rather medieval,
miracle-conscious,"unreasonable" way of thinking, for which Wigner
(one of the greatest physicists, and a close friend of Einstein's) was
heavily criticized.

[fn:2]Counter arguments one might bring forward: what about astronomy
and astrology of the ancient world? The answer: these (pseudo)
sciences never left the sphere that bounded the world. 

[fn:1]The German words for this are "Daseinsgefühl" (the feeling one
has when existing), and "Weltbild" (a view of the whole world).
