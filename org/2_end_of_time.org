“It is taken increasingly for granted that man ought to be treated as
an object. Man confronts this attitude in the range of authority
exercised over him; he may merely meet it in countless statistics and
tables or he may experience its culmination in an unspeakable rape of
the individual, of the group, even of the whole nation.”

-- Romano Guardini (1956)

  War II, The End of the Modern World is a bracing, sometimes bleak
  jeremiad against the dehumanizing dangers of what we now call
  postmodernism. Guardini is not a pessimist, but he is vitally
  concerned about the potential loss of human dignity and individual
  responsibility in a world culture dominated by technological
  utilitarianism."
