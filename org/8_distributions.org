[fn:3]In this example, ~Pr(A|B) = Pr(B|A)~ - if A has occurred already,
one of {4,5,6} has been rolled, and the chance to roll an even number
is also ~Pr(B|A) = 2/3~ ({4} or {6} out of {4,5,6}).

[fn:2]Apparently, Randall Munroe's, the author of the xkcd cartoon's
fiance√© had cancer and passed away a few days after this comic was
posted. Its subtitle is: "My normal approach is useless here, too".

[fn:1]One of these paradoxes is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle][Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]:
"We cannot know both the position and the speed of a particle, such as
a photon or electron, with perfect accuracy": \Delta x \Delta y \sim h
