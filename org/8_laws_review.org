- A few exercises to review the "Laws of probability" DataCamp lesson.
- You can find the solutions to these questions in GitHub (pdf repo)

* TODO Problems

1) What does [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/blob/main/img/dc_prob.png][this figure]] illustrate?

2) What is ~Pr(A \cap B)~ (AND) for independent events ~A~ and ~B~?

3) What is ~Pr(A \cap B)~ as a Venn diagram?

4) What happens to the Venn diagram if the probabilities are not equal?

5) How do you simulate ~Pr(A \cap B)~ if ~Pr(A)=0.4~ and ~Pr(B)=.2~?

6) What is ~Pr(A \cup B)~ (OR) as a Venn diagram?

7) What is ~Pr(A \cup B)~ for independent events ~A~ and ~B~?

8) A and B are independent events. How do you simulate ~Pr(A \cup B)~ if
   ~Pr(A) = 0.2~ and ~Pr(B) = 0.6~?

9) Multiplying a random variable by a factor will also multiply the
   expected value by that factor.

   Create a histogram of ~X \tilde Binomial(10,0.5)~ and a histogram
   ~Y\tilde3*X~, put them into one plot array, and show the expected
   value in each histogram.

   Remember that the x-axis scales for each plot are chosen based on
   the plot data - you have to align them to make the plots comparable.

10) The multiplication rule for random variables also applies to the
    spread. Use a function to show how the spread changes in the
    previous example, from X to Y.

11) What is the expected value of the binomial distributions X + Y?
    Print the expected value of X, Y and X+Y.
    #+begin_src R

    #+end_src

12) Can you put the three distributions X, Y, and X + Y into one plot
    array to make them comparable, and indicate the expected values
    with thick red, blue and yellow vertical lines?

    Remember that the x-axis scales for each plot are chosen based on
    the plot data - you have to align them to make the plots comparable.

13) Do expected value and variance follow simple additive laws if the
    underlying distributions are not independent? Why or why not?
