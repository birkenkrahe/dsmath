3. Exercises with ~sample~ and ~replicate~

* What is a 'probability'?
[[../img/7_probability_and_statistics.png]]

- A number that describes the magnitude of chance associated with
  making a particular observation or statement.

- Probability is always a continuous number p \in [0,1].

- This abstract-mathematical notion becomes tangible only in context
  with an (observable) event that can be predicted

- Probability theory predicts event data based on models (e.g. CLT)

- Statistics predicts models (e.g. ~mean~) given event data

* Events and probability

- An event A refers to a specific outcome that can occur.

- The chance that A occurs is denoted as Pr(A). Pr(A) = 1 means that
  an event will occur with absolute certainty, Pr(A) = 0 means that it
  cannot occur ever.

- Pr(A) is known as a /frequentist/ or /classical/ probability. It is the
  relative frequency with which an event occurs over many identical,
  objective trials.

- Chance computations always are models that live and die on their
  assumptions, i.e. reality is modeled as an abstraction.

* Example 1: fair die
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/7_fairdie.png]]

- Example: the six-sided, "fair" die, which does not exist, has Pr(A)
  = 1/6 for every one of its outcomes A \in {1,2,3,4,5,6}. The die roll
  is assumed to be identical and objective, though it never really is.

- The (empirical) law of large numbers guarantees that a large enough
  number of observations will yield the ideal Pr(A).

* Example 2: quantum particle
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/7_cat.png]]

- In quantum physics, particles no longer have a definite position but
  instead a probability distribution ("Heisenberg uncertainty
  principle"[fn:1])

- Quantum physics is also a model-based abstraction of the real
  world. Its applications (like the laser, nuclear power etc.) are
  still real.

* Example 3: Bayesian marriage
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/7_marriage.jpg]]

- Say you're married and arrive home much later than usual.

- Let B be the event "your partner is angry" because you're late.

- B cannot easily /objectively/ observed or computed.

- Instead, you might assign a value to Pr(B) based on experience: "I
  think Pr(B) = 0.5" because your experience tells you that your
  chances are 50-50.

- Instead of an impartial experiment, your chance computation is based
  on personal impression and knowledge of your spouse or mood, and it
  is not easily /reproducable/.

- This is known as /Bayesian/ probability, which uses prior knowledge or
  subjective belief to inform the computation (smaller samples needed)

* Conditional probability (Bayes' rule)

Die example: 
#+begin_quote
Event A: "you roll a 4 or more" - Pr(A) = 1/2
Event B: "you roll an even number" - Pr(B) = 1/2
#+end_quote
- A /conditional/ probability is the probability of one event occurring
  after taking into account the occurrence of another event.

- P(A|B) is the probability that A occurs /given/ that B has occurred.
- If Pr(A|B) = Pr(A) then A and B are /independent/
- If Pr(A|B) \ne Pr(A) then A and B are /dependent/
- Generally, Pr(A|B) \ne Pr(B|A)

- If B has occurred already, an even number {2,4,6} has been rolled,
  and the chance to roll a 4 or more is Pr(A|B) = 2/3 \ne Pr(A) = 1/2.

- If A has occurred already, one of {4,5,6} has been rolled, and the
  chance to roll an even number is Pr(B|A) = Pr(A|B) = 2/3 \ne Pr(B) =
  1/2.

[fn:2]Apparently, Randall Munroe's, the author of the xkcd cartoon's
fianceé had cancer and passed away a few days after this comic was
posted. Its subtitle is: "My normal approach is useless here, too".

[fn:1]One of these paradoxes is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle][Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]:
"We cannot know both the position and the speed of a particle, such as
a photon or electron, with perfect accuracy": \Delta x \Delta y \sim h
