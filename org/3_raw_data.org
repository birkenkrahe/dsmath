* What is statistics?

#+begin_quote
"Statistics are all around us, from marketing to sales to
healthcare. The ability to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from
data is not only extremely valuable, but it is also becoming
commonplace to expect roles that are not traditionally analytical to
understand the fundamental concepts of statistics." (DataCamp, n.d.)

- Which information does this "definition" contain?

  #+begin_notes
  - Application of statistics (marketing, sales, healthcare)
  - Input (data), process (collect, analyze), and output (conclusions)
  - Importance (commonplace)

- Okay, but what *is* statistics?

  #+begin_notes
  Statistics is the practice of turning data into information to
  identify trends and understand features of populations. (Davies, 2016)

  #+begin_notes
  Statistics is all about using the data from samples to draw
  conclusions about populations. (Schmuller, 2017)

- Lat. "/datum/" = that what is given

- /Raw/ data = records or observations that make up a /sample/

- /Big/ data = Volume + Velocity + Variety[fn:1]

* What is data to R?



- Data can be /read in/ from external files (e.g. ~read.table~)

- Data can be /stored/ as R objects (e.g. ~data.frame~)

- Data can be /summarized/ and /analyzed/ using R functions (e.g. ~summary~)

* Numeric variables
* Categorical variables
* Univariate and multivariate data
* Parameter or statistic?

[fn:1]This is the "3V" definition of big data. You'll find other
attributes, like "value" or "veracity", which are not directly
measurable, however.
