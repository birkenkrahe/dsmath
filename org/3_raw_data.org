* What is statistics?

#+begin_quote
"Statistics are all around us, from marketing to sales to
healthcare. The ability to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from
data is not only extremely valuable, but it is also becoming
commonplace to expect roles that are not traditionally analytical to
understand the fundamental concepts of statistics." (DataCamp, n.d.)
#+end_quote

- Which information does this "definition" contain?

  #+begin_notes
  - Application of statistics (marketing, sales, healthcare)
  - Input (data), process (collect, analyze), and output (conclusions)
  - Importance (commonplace)
  #+end_notes

- Okay, but what *is* statistics?

  #+begin_notes
  Statistics is the practice of turning data into information to
  identify trends and understand features of populations. (Davies, 2016)
  #+end_notes

  #+begin_notes
  Statistics is all about using the data from samples to draw
  conclusions about populations. (Schmuller, 2017)

* What is data?
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/3_creation.png]]

- Lat. "/datum/" = that what is given:
  1) entity - for example a corporation or a school
  2) event - for example an event like an election
  3) process - for example a marketing campaign

- /Raw/ data = records or observations that make up a /sample/

- /Big/ data = Volume + Velocity + Variety[fn:1]

* What is data to R?

[[../img/3_data.jpg]]

- Data can be /read in/ from external files (e.g. ~read.table~[fn:2])

- Data can be /stored/ as R objects (e.g. ~data.frame~)

- Data can be /summarized/ and /analyzed/ using R functions (e.g. ~summary~)
  
* Variables

- In statistics, /variables/ are characteristics of individuals in a population

- An /individual/ and /population/ are (useful) abstractions (*Why?*)

- First step: identify and categorize the available variables

* Extended example: data frames

  - We use the ~data.frame~ function to create a data frame from scratch

  - Data are supplied as /vectors/ of the same length

  - Data are grouped by variable

  - R code:
    #+name: mydata
    #+begin_src R :session *R* :results output
      mydata <- data.frame (
        person = c("Peter", "Lois", "Meg", "Chris", "Stewie"),
        age = c(42, 40, 17, 14, 1),
        sex = factor( c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")))
    #+end_src

  - R variables: vector of strings, numbers, ~factor~ vector

  - To see the structure of an R object, use the function ~str~.
    #+name: str
    #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
     str(mydata)
    #+end_src

  - To extract portions of the data, use index operators ~$~ and ~[]~.
    #+name: subset
    #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
      ## extract row 2 in column 2
      mydata[2,2] 

      ## extract rows 2 to 5 in column 2
      mydata[3:5,2]

      ## extract age
      mydata$age

      ## extract Lois' age (row 2, column 2)
      mydata$age[2]
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS: subset
    : [1] 40
    : [1] 17 14  1
    : [1] 42 40 17 14  1
    : [1] 40

  - To report size of data frames - number of records and variables,
    or rows and columns, use ~nrow~, ~ncol~ and ~dim~.
    #+name: size
    #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
      nrow(mydata) # retrieve number of rows or records

      ncol(mydata) # retrieve number of columns or variables

      dim(mydata)  # retrieve both number of rows and columns
    #+end_src

[fn:2]/You can get help on any of the examples with ~?~ or ~help()~.

[fn:1]This is the "3V" definition of big data. You'll find other
attributes, like "value" or "veracity", which are not directly
measurable, however.
