- How did people in antiquity experience and view the world?[fn:1]
- How did people in the middle ages experience and view the world?
- How do we in the modern age experience and view the world?
- What does this have to do with statistics and probability?

The essay '[[https://www.amazon.com/End-Modern-World-Romano-Guardini/dp/1882926587][The End of the Modern World]]' by Romano Guardini gave me the
idea for this section. It was born out of the thought that probability
as the foundation of statistics, is a profoundly *modern* concept, and I
was wondering if a brief historical, non-technical, philosophical
journey might help us orient ourselves towards it.

Guardini's book will appear pessimistic to non-faithful readers. It
was however, written to help people in Germany right after WW II get a
sense of purpose and orientation that they had lost after 12 years of
life under the Nazis.

The book is strangely prophetic in many ways - probably because it was
quite clear around the middle of the 20th century, what the essence of
modernity was, and where the journey would lead us in the 21st
century.

I'm offering this section to you because the DSC 482 classes should also
have a "senior spirit" of discourse and critical discussion, which one
cannot get from topical (in this case: statistics) textbooks alone.

base of this altar from a temple for Zeus is a relief showing the
battle between the Giants and the Olympian gods
("Gigantomachy"). Excavated by the German engineer Carl Humann
1878-1886, this is at the heart of the Pergamon-Museum in Berlin. This
altar stood in the ancient city of Troy (of Homer's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad][Iliad]]).

* SUMMARY
#+attr_html: :width 700px
#+caption: Jacques-Louis David - Death of Socrates (1787)
[[../img/2_socrates.jpg]]

1. From Ancient Greece, ca. 400 BC to the End of Rome, ca. 476 AD
2. Socrates & Plato (philosophy), Aristotle (physics), Euclid (maths)
3. The world is a (closed) ball or sphere within which the Gods live
   with us; man must search for truth and experiment with hypotheses.

#+begin_notes
/Image: David, Death of Socrates (1787)./ The Greek philosopher and
distinguished veteran of the Peloponnesian war, Socrates (469-399 BC),
was convicted of impiety by the Athenian court. Instead of renouncing
his beliefs, he died willingly, discoursing on the immortality of the
soul before drinking poisonous hemlock.

Guardini: "Classical man never went beyond his world; his feeling for
life, his imagination and his vision of existence were one with the
limited world he knew. He never asked himself whether or not something
might exist beyond his known world [...] because he lacked any
relation which could transcend his world."

"Classical man /could not even conceive/ of a desire to break the limits
of his world. To do so those limits must have already been
broken. This was simply not the case."[fn:2]

This implies the impossibility of thinking up a concept like
'probability'. However, classical man had mathematics as defined by
Wigner (1960): /"Mathematics is the science of skillful operations with
concepts and rules invented just for this purpose./ Euclid's elements
are an example, and his geometry was enough for Aristotle to explain
many natural phenomena (though the classical concept of "nature" has
got nothing to do with our modern idea of "nature")[fn:3]:

"Greek scientific thought was marked by flexbility and absence of
dogmatism. The Greek mind was gripped by an endless quest for
understanding of the ways of the world. Nothing however, had been
decided conclusively; every question remained open, waiting to be
answered further. Every philosophical reflection might contain the
answer to life; therefore it could compete with any other possible
supposition. Always, however, one had to remain within the limits laid
down by the fundamental ethos of the Greek world. These limits could
not be transgressed, and the trial of Socrates attest to the strnegth
of this prohibition."

depicts the annunciation of Mary by the Archangel Gabriel. The words
in the painting can only be read upside-down to indicate that they are
addressed to God, who wold be in the proper position to read them.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortona][Cortona]], my own favorite place in Italy, is a small medieval town in
Tuscany - it was supposedly founded by one of Noah's sons, Crano, 273
years after the Great Flood. The city was already inhabited by
Etruscans at least since the 7th century BC. Lake Trasimeno where
Scipio the younger defeated Hannibal after he had crossed the Alps
with elephants, can be seen from Cortona. Next to the town is a small
convent, Le Celle, where St Francis of Assisi lived in a tiny cell.

"The crucial truth for medieval man was the fact of Divine Revelation
[...] set forth within the dogma of the Church [which] bound and
limited man by its authority; [but also] made it possible to surmount
this world. Revealed truth was conceptualized by means of a delicate
logic which distinguished and then united all of reality. The
theological system erect upon these foundations unfolded itself as a
great synthesis. In the modern sense of the term, however, scientific
explanation was almost unknown. The one point of departure for science
in the medieval intellectual synthesis was authority, that of
antiquity and especially the work of Aristotle" (384-322 BC), himself
a disciple of Plato's. "The Middle Ages had established a relationship
with antiquity which, although seemingly naive, was constructive."

"This drive for reconciliation [with antiquity] is crystallized in the
/Summae/, which united theology and philosophy, sociology and
morality. [...] Medieval man neither wished to explore the mysteries
of the world empirically nor did he want to illuminate them by a
rational methodology. He was interested in building his world out of
the content of Revelation and upon the principles and insights of
classical [Greek] philosophy. The /Summae/ are that world as it was
erected by the human mind. They can be compared with the medieval
cathedral in which every form and artifact [...] were given a symbolic
value which made possible a life and a sense of being integrally
religious in nature."

"What medieval man lacked was any desire for exact, empirical
knowledge of reality. [But] unless we free ourselves of the
evaluations made by the minds of the Renaissance and the
Enlightenment, we cannot really understand the Middle Ages. The
judgements then leveled were made under the pressure of a polemic,
which has succeeded in distorting the truth even to our own
day. Equally distorted was the glorified Middle Ages of the
Romantics."

"The Middle Ages were filled with a sense of religion, which was as
deep as it was rich, as strong as it was delicate, as firm in its
grasp of principles as it was original and fertile in their concrete
expression. From cloister and monastery there sone a religious light
whose strength cannot be overestimated. Medieval man thirsted for the
truth. [...] This passion for understanding, however, had nothing in
common with our modern enthusiasm for the techniques of scientific
investigation. Medieval man was interested neither in pursuing nature
and history empirically nor in mastering reality theoretically. He
chose to plunge into truth by way of meditation."

conference! - Particle accelerators like the LHC, and the data
processing surrounding a particle physics experiment are among the
greatest "big data" events you can think of: ALICE, one of the
detectors located in the cross-section shown above, has more than 12
billion sensors that create a data stream of more than 3.5 terabytes
per second, or 300 petabytes per day, which is more than the estimated
data created world-wide per day.

/Image:/ The grayscale painting "Guernica" by Picasso (1937) depics the bombing
on the Spanish city of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. It is
also a typical cubist-surrealist painting where reality is dissolved
in geometric patterns and symbols, distorted and disfigured to achieve
a heightened effect.

"[In the modern age,] man's passion for knowledge began to lead him
away from authority, pointing him directly toward real things. He
chose to probe things with his own intelligence and to reach
established judgements which were independent of any pattern first
laid down by authority."

"Man begin to find his own individuality an absorbing object for
study, for introspection and psychological analysis. [...] *Genius*
became the most important measure of human value [and] the standard
for all human judgements."

"Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom" (Kierkegaard, 1844): "Modern
anxiety arises from man's deep-seated consciousness that he lacks
either a 'real' or a symbolic place in reality. In spite of his actual
position on Earth, he is a being without security. The very needs of
man's senses are left unsatisfied, since he has ceased to experience a
world which guarantees him a place in the total scheme of existence."

'Arkansas - the natural state': "Nature was all those things which
existed in the world prior to anything man did to them; it was also
the sum total of energy, matter, essences and natural laws [and] made
a matter of value in itself. [Nature] became the norm which guided man
in action and in reason toward whatever was right or healthful or
perfect."

"Prior to the Renaissance, only the Work of God had an absolute
meaning; after the Renaissance, the world ceased to be the Creation of
God. It had become the work of Nature. Similarly the work of a man
ceased to be an act of obedience to God's ordained service; it became
a 'creation' in itself. Previously a worshipper and a servant, man now
took to himself the prerogatives of a 'creator'."

Science and technology as the new religion - Goethe: "Who possesses
science and art, possesses religion as well." - "The three-sided
vision [of 'nature', 'personality', and 'culture'] harmonized with the
conceptions upon which modern science was being built. From modern
science, technology has grown, and technology is a concentration of
processes allowing man to posit ends in conformity with his own
desires [...] and cut themselves away from an ethic which once had
bound men universally."

- Uncertainty about the position of man in reality: “It is [now] taken
  increasingly for granted that man ought to be treated as an
  object. Man confronts this attitude in the range of authority
  exercised over him; he may merely meet it in countless statistics
  and tables or he may experience its culmination in an unspeakable
  rape of the individual, of the group, even of the whole nation.”
  Guardini (1956)

- Unknown relationship between probability and reality: "Perhaps there
  are further metaphysical desiderata that we might impose on the
  interpretations. For example, there appear to be connections between
  probability and modality. Events with positive probability can
  happen, even if they don’t. Some authors also insist on the converse
  condition that only events with positive probability can happen,
  although this is more controversial." (Hajek, 2019)

- Free will remains elusive as a concept: "Attempts have been made to
  link the existence of free will with the indeterminacy of quantum
  mechanics, but it is difficult to see how this feature of the theory
  makes free will more plausible. On the contrary, free will
  presumably implies rational thought and decision, whereas the
  essence of the indeterminism in quantum mechanics is that it is due
  to intrinsic randomness." (Britannica) 

- The search for religion is alive and well among scientists, too: see
  e.g. "[[https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/things.html][Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About]]", by Don Knuth.

* LIKELIHOOD IS AT THE CORE OF SCIENCE

Science is not about hard truths but about estimates of likelihood.

#+begin_quote
"It is scientific to say what is more likely and what is less likely,
and not to prove all the time what is possible or impossible: from
what I see around me, from my knowledge of the world, it is much more
likely that the reports of flying saucers are the reports of the
known, irrational characteristics of terrestrial intelligence rather
than the unknown, rational efforts of extraterrestrial intelligence."

  Anxiety as both modern man's curse and saving grace: "I would say
  that learning to know anxiety is an adventure which every man has to
  affront if he would not go to perdition either by not having known
  anxiety or by sinking under it. He therefore who has learned rightly
  to be anxious has learned the most important thing."

  "After an introductory first session, the second lecture focuses on
  the interaction of randomization and religion, since randomization
  has become a key area of scientific interest during the past few
  decades. The third lecture considers questions of language
  translation, with many examples drawn from the author's experiments
  in which random verses of the Bible were analyzed in depth. The
  fourth one deals with art and aesthetics; it illustrates several
  ways in which beautiful presentations can greatly deepen our
  perception of difficult concepts. The fifth lecture discusses what
  the author learned from the "3:16 project," a personal exploration
  of Biblical literature which he regards as a turning point in his
  own life. The sixth and final lecture, "God and Computer Science,"
  is largely independent of the other five. It deals with several new
  perspectives by which concepts of computer science help to shed
  light on many ancient and difficult questions previously addressed
  by scientists in other fields."

  There is an extension of Wigner's thought by Turing Prize laureate
  [[https://math.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Hamming.html][Richard Hamming (1980)]]. He observed: "When examining [Einstein's
  1905] special theory of relativity paper one has the feeling that
  one is dealing with a scholastic philosopher's approach. He knew in
  advance what the theory should look like. and he explored the
  theories with mathematical tools, not actual experiments. He was so
  confident of the rightness of the relativity theories that, when
  experiments were done to check them, he was not much interested in
  the outcomes, saying that they had to come out that way or else the
  experiments were wrong. And many people believe that the two
  relativity theories rest more on philosophical grounds than on
  actual experiments." As a modern man, Hamming claims "Mathematics
  has been made by man."

* Footnotes

[fn:3]Wigner's 1960 paper is still worth reading. He writes about the
"miracle of appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the
formulation of the laws of physics," and admits that "we do not know
why our theories work so well." This is a rather medieval,
miracle-conscious,"unreasonable" way of thinking, for which Wigner
(one of the greatest physicists, and a close friend of Einstein's) was
heavily criticized.

[fn:2]Counter arguments one might bring forward: what about astronomy
and astrology of the ancient world? The answer: these (pseudo)
sciences never left the sphere that bounded the world.

[fn:1]The German words for this are "Daseinsgefühl" (the feeling one
has when existing), and "Weltbild" (a view of the whole world).
