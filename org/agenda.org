* README

- DSC 482 focuses on statistics, probability and distributions
- We use R as a language, GNU Emacs as editor, ESS as statistics
  extension, and Org-mode for literate programming
- For details on objectives, audience, grading, schedule, check the
  [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/blob/main/org/syllabus.org][syllabus]] or the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org][FAQ]] on GitHub.
- This file contains a (dynamically updated) agenda for each session
  as well as some content.
- You can also look at [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/blob/main/org/agenda.org][the agenda on GitHub]].

#+begin_quote
In DSC 482/MTH 445 (Applied maths for data science), I do NOT assume
familiarity with R. We will learn the language as we go along. This
will necessarily slow us down but this is a math/computing course, so
concepts (in this case probability/statistics) are as important as
coding. Textbook: Book of R, Part III (ch. 13-16), by T D Davies
(NoStarch, 2016).

- General preparation: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-can-i-prepare-for-your-data-science-classes][see the FAQ]] - R, Emacs + ESS + Org-mode

#+begin_notes
Bill Gates committed what is called a statistical "Type II" error,
when in 2004, he said "Two years from now, spam will be solved." Not
rejecting this null hypothesis by Microsoft, arguably lead to
underestimating spam (2014: above 70% of all emails sent, 2021: above
45% of all emails sent).

** Quick entry test analysis

#+begin_src R :results output graphics file :file ../img/entry_hist.png
  results <- c(10.67, 9.67, 13.83, 7.83, 7.17, 11.67, 11.67, 10.83, 9.67, 11.67, 14.42)
  hist_results <- hist(results)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:../img/entry_hist.png]]

#+begin_src R :results output graphics file :file ../img/entry_dens.png
  results <- c(10.67, 9.67, 13.83, 7.83, 7.17, 11.67, 11.67, 10.83, 9.67, 11.67, 14.42)
  plot(density(results))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

* Group exercise: orientation

#+begin_quote
"Probability is the most important concept in modern science,
especially as nobody has the slightest notion what it means."

â€”Bertrand Russell, 1929 Lecture (cited in Bell 1945, 587)

- *Group 1: Antiquity / Classical man*
  1. What historical time period are we talking about?
  2. Do you know anyone from that time and what they said, wrote or did?
  3. What were the world-views of people in antiquity?

- *Group 2: Middle ages / Medieval man*
  1. What historical time period are we talking about?
  2. Do you know anyone from that time and what they said, wrote or did?
  3. What were the world-views of people in the middle ages?

- *Group 3: Modern world / Mass man*
  1. What historical time period are we talking about?
  2. Do you know anyone from that time and what they said, wrote or did?
  3. What are the world-views of people in the modern era?
  4. What is the importance of statistics and probability today?

- Collect your insights [[https://ideaboardz.com/for/Data%20Science%20At%20The%20End%20Of%20Time/4595645][on this online board]] (10 min for all)

- Present your insights to the class (5 min per group)

- Summary discussion / lecture
  
* Practice - course infrastructure

*Useful:* take notes! Practice leads to mastery and the practice
exercises will often come back to haunt you in the tests.

1) Open a browser
2) Find the GitHub repos (birkenkrahe/dviz and /org)
3) Open the command line terminal
4) Open/close R
5) Open Emacs
6) Find the Emacs tutorial
7) Open/close R inside Emacs
8) Run R in an Org-mode file
9) Close Emacs
10) Close the command line terminal

*Note:* Class room practice completion = 10 points each for active
participation.
