* README

- DSC 482 focuses on statistics, probability and distributions
- We use R as a language, GNU Emacs as editor, ESS as statistics
  extension, and Org-mode for literate programming
- For details on objectives, audience, grading, schedule, check the
  [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/blob/main/org/syllabus.org][syllabus]] or the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org][FAQ]] on GitHub.
- This file contains a (dynamically updated) agenda for each session
  as well as some content.

#+begin_quote
In DSC 482/MTH 445 (Applied maths for data science), I do NOT assume
familiarity with R. We will learn the language as we go along. This
will necessarily slow us down but this is a math/computing course, so
concepts (in this case probability/statistics) are as important as
coding. Textbook: Book of R, Part III (ch. 13-16), by T D Davies
(NoStarch, 2016).
#+end_quote

- General preparation: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-can-i-prepare-for-your-data-science-classes][see the FAQ]] - R, Emacs + ESS + Org-mode

#+begin_notes
Bill Gates committed what is called a statistical "Type II" error,
when in 2004, he said "Two years from now, spam will be solved." Not
rejecting this null hypothesis by Microsoft, arguably lead to
underestimating spam (2014: above 70% of all emails sent, 2021: above
45% of all emails sent).

** Practice - course infrastructure

*Useful:* take notes! Practice leads to mastery and the practice
exercises will often come back to haunt you in the tests.

1) Open a browser
2) Find the GitHub repos (birkenkrahe/dviz and /org)
3) Open the command line terminal
4) Open/close R
5) Open Emacs
6) Find the Emacs tutorial
7) Open/close R inside Emacs
8) Run R in an Org-mode file
9) Close Emacs
10) Close the command line terminal

*Note:* Class room practice completion = 10 points each for active
participation.

- Canvas Gradebook is updated manually (with some delay)

** Getting started with projects

- Course has 14 participants!

- You'll have to do the project in a team - 2 to 3 people

- We can only accommodate at most 8 projects (last week of term)

- Put your team/ideas into this table ([[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/655/pages/enter-your-project-ideas-and-team-here][Canvas]]) by Thursday

- [X] *Who has not yet found a team?*

- [X] *Who has a team but no idea what to do?*

- Reminder: plenty of project opportunities ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/blob/main/org/1_overview.org#many-project-opportunities][overview]] / GitHub [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/issues][issues]])

- What are "measures of center"? Which ones do you know?
- What are "measures of spread?" Which ones do you know?

#+begin_notes
- *Limitation of statistics:* cannot be used to find out *why*
  relationships exist, i.e. does not establish causation
- *Measures of center:* summarize data
  + mean or average
  + median or middle value
  + mode or most frequent value
- *Measures of spread:* indicate variety or clustering
  + range or min/max distance
  + variance or average distance from mean
  + standard deviation or square root of variance

Figure: "Adjusted odds ratios for confirmed cases of covid-19 by
interval after vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 before 4
January 2021 in those aged 80 years and older".

"Odds ratios are used to compare the relative odds of the occurrence
of the outcome of interest (e.g. disease or disorder), given
exposure to the variable of interest (e.g. health characteristic,
aspect of medical history). The odds ratio can also be used to
determine whether a particular exposure is a risk factor for a
particular outcome, and to compare the magnitude of various risk
factors for that outcome:
- OR=1 Exposure does not affect odds of outcome
- OR>1 Exposure associated with higher odds of outcome
- OR<1 Exposure associated with lower odds of outcome"

** DONE Recap and exercise: data frames

- [ ] R functions:
  + ~data.frame~ - table, column vectors (like SQL)
  + ~c~ - creating vectors, concatenation
  + ~factor~ - vectors that hold categorical variables
  + ~str~ - structure of any R object
  + ~$~, ~[]~ - indexing operators
  + *NEW*: [[file:3_raw_data.org][subset]]

- Test questions:
  + How can you extract a vector named ~bar~ from a data frame named ~foo~? R command: ~foo$bar~
  + How can you extract elements with multiple conditions?
  + How can you find out how many rows and columns a data frame has?

  #+begin_notes
  1) ~foo$bar~ - if you know the column number ~N~: ~foo[,N]~,
     e.g. ~mtcars[,1]~ for the ~mpg~ column (~N=1~).
  2) By using logical expressions
  3) ~dim~, ~nrow~ x ~ncol~, ~str~
  #+end_notes

[[../img/1_scrum.png]]

*** "Pride"

- Pride according to the Oxford dictionary:
  #+begin_quote
  »A feeling of being pleased or satisfied that you get when you or
  people who are connected with you have *done something well* or *own
  something* that other people *admire*.«
  #+end_quote
  In other words: if you cannot identify what you're proud of, you either haven't done anything well, or you're not aware of it, which won't do.

- Of course, /"pride comes before the fall"/ (Proverbs 16:18), but in
  the context of Scrum, it is only one of several qualities to assess
  the results of a sprint.

*** "References"
#+attr_html: :width 600px
[[../img/litref.png]]

- Some of you mentioned references, few provided any
- To do this week: Literature Review with [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/pdf/LitReview.pdf][cheat sheet]].
- [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/research/LitReview.docx][Download it from GitHub]], find at least 5 references, label them
  according to the categories (esp. relevance and credibility), and
  provide a complete, consistent set of citations.

*** "Questions"
#+attr_html: :width 600px
[[../img/meeting.jpg]]

- You should always use an opportunity to ask the customer/product
  owner anything, even if it's something simple. (*Why?*)

- Good question are specific, open (not closed as in yes/no), and use
  the qualities (as in: variables!) that you're after, e.g. "What do
  you like about me in terms of punctuality, systematic work,
  appearance..."

- A question is specific if you can immediately use it to take an
  action!

*Only one team asked questions at all (Nikkolette/Wyatt):*
- /What was the hardest part so far for you?/
- /What was the most interesting part you have found/want to find?/

*** Better next time!

[[../img/mountain.jpg]]

1) Deliver more than the bare minimum *generously*
2) Try to make your project great by working *systematically*
3) If you have a team, split up the work *meaningfully*
4) If you have any questions, ask others and me *bravely*
5) Complete the (optional) literature review *diligently*

** DONE Practice: raw data stats (30 min)

- I support some but not all recommendations:
  1) "Build skills with low-pressure projects" (i.e. play around)
  2) Don't worry about style but worry about documentation
  3) "Join the R community" - [[https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/figure?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010372.g002][I also use Twitter]]
  4) "Read others' code, and share yours" - use GitHub
  5) "Don't box yourself in" - use languages for what they're good at

** Review: test 4 - raw data, probability and stats

- [X] Longitude/latitude are what kind of data?
- [X] When researching, do you always need a "literature review"?
  - "Literature review" as a type of paper is the most useful
    paper you can find as a beginner - look for one in your
    project area!
- [X] Which activities connect "population" and "sample"?

** Review: probability and distributions (DataCamp)

1) What is the conditional probability for an event B given that an
   event A has already happened (as a formula)
   #+begin_notes
   Formula: P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)
   #+end_notes

2) How can you visualize the conditional probability formula for
   events A and B?

   #+begin_notes
   Example: A = Order for kitchen products, B = Orders over $150
   #+attr_html: :width 500px
   [[../img/kitchen1.png]]
   #+end_notes

3) A men's soccer team plays soccer zero, one, or two days a week:
   - the probability that they play zero days is .2,
   - the probability that they play one day is .5, and
   - the probability that they play two days is .3.

     What is the long-term average or expected value, μ, of the number
     of days per week that the men's soccer team plays soccer?

   #+begin_notes
   | x = DAYS | P(x) |
   |----------+------|
   |        0 |  0.2 |
   |        1 |  0.5 |
   |        2 |  0.3 |

   Expected value:
   E(DAYS) = μ = ∑ x P(x) = 0 * 0.2 + 1 * .5 + 2 * .3 = 1.1
   #+end_notes

   #+begin_src R
     ## number of days the team plays per week
     x <- c(0,1,2)  # events
     p_x <- c(0.2, 0.5, 0.3) # probability per event
     mu <- sum(x * p_x) # expected value
     paste("expected value: ", mu)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : expected value:  1.1

4) What is the /law of large numbers/?

   #+begin_notes
   As the size of your sample increases, the sample mean will
   approach the expected value (the population average).
   #+end_notes

   #+begin_src R :file ../img/sample.png :results output graphics file
     x <- sample(rep(1:6),size=10,replace=TRUE)
     hist(x, xlab="10 rolls, fair dice", main="die roll")
     abline(v = mean(x), col="red",lwd=2)
     abline(v = sum(x/6),col="blue",lwd=2)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:../img/sample.png]]

5) What is the probability that a baby will be born between midnight
   and 8 am? (If all hours are equally probable.)

   #+begin_notes
   A day has 24 hours - midnight to 8 am is 8/24 or 1/3, so 33%.
   #+end_notes

  "The scientists took a data-driven approach. They gathered data on all
  the organelle DNA that has been sequenced across life. They then used
  modeling, biochemistry, and structural biology to represent a wide
  range of different hypotheses about gene retention as a set of numbers
  associated with each gene. Using tools from data science and
  statistics, they asked which ideas could best explain the patterns of
  retained genes in the data they had compiled—testing the results with
  unseen data to check their power."

- [ ] 2nd sprint review

#+begin_notes
One of the most influential statisticians of the 20th century, John
Wilder Tukey (1915–2000), played a key role in both the development
and study of statistics. A prolific writer, his collected papers
amount to eight volumes of work. Beyond his scientific work, his
collection reveals two hobbies: reading pulp mysteries and science
fiction, and square dancing. The above carefully posed picture shows
his lighter side: sampled data comes in one ear and goes out the
other, regularized. ([[https://www.amphilsoc.org/item-detail/photograph-john-wilder-tukey][Source]])

* TODO (Thu) Test 6 review
#+attr_html: :width 300px
[[file:lp.png]]

*Which questions can you answer?*

1) The data set ~chickwts~ contains chick ~weight~ and types of
   ~feed~. Which statistical *measures of centrality* are affected by the
   number of chicks?
   #+begin_src R
     paste("Number of observations: ", nrow(chickwts))
     w <- chickwts$weight
     f <- chickwts$feed
     ftab <- table(f)
     paste("Sum of frequencies: ", sum(ftab))
     wtab <- table(w)
     paste("Sum of frequencies: ", sum(wtab))
     paste("Median: ", median(w))
     paste("Mean:   ", mean(w))
     paste("Mode:   ", ftab[ftab == max(ftab)])
   #+end_src

2) What is the proportion of chicks fed both sunflower and meatmeal?
   #+begin_src R
     feed <- chickwts$feed
     sum(feed == "sunflower" & feed == "meatmeal")/nrow(chickwts)
   #+end_src

3) What does the ~tapply~ function do, and what are its arguments?

4) What is the output of this ~tapply~ command?
   #+begin_src R
     tapply(X = chickwts$weight, INDEX = chickwts$feed, FUN = summary)
   #+end_src

5) Commonality of dotplot/scatterplot vs. histogram/barchart?
   #+begin_quote
   »Dot plots/scatterplot: point plots generated by coordinate
   vectors. Histogram/barplot: bar charts generated for categories and
   counts.
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file ../demo.png
     par(mfrow=c(2,2))
     x <- c(2, 4, 5.5, -1, 4.56)
     y <- c(2, 4, 5.5, -1, 4.56)
     plot(x,y, main="Scatterplot")
     hist(x, main="Histogram")
     dotchart(x, main="Dot plot")
     barplot(height=y,horiz=TRUE, main="Barchart")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
