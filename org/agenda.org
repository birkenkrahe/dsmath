- DSC 482 focuses on statistics, probability and distributions
- We use R as a language, GNU Emacs as editor, ESS as statistics
  extension, and Org-mode for [[http://www.literateprogramming.com/][literate programming]]
- For details on objectives, audience, grading, schedule, check the
  [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/blob/main/org/syllabus.org][syllabus]] or the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org][FAQ]] on GitHub.
- This file contains a (dynamically updated) agenda for each session
  as well as some content, mostly review of the lectures

#+begin_quote
In DSC 482/MTH 445 (Applied maths for data science), I do NOT assume
familiarity with R. We will learn the language as we go along. This
will necessarily slow us down but this is a math/computing course, so
concepts (in this case probability/statistics) are as important as
coding. Textbook: Book of R, Part III (ch. 13-16), by T D Davies
(NoStarch, 2016).
#+end_quote

- General preparation: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-can-i-prepare-for-your-data-science-classes][see the FAQ]] - R, Emacs + ESS + Org-mode

#+begin_notes
Bill Gates committed what is called a statistical "Type II" error,
when in 2004, he said "Two years from now, spam will be solved." Not
rejecting this null hypothesis by Microsoft, arguably lead to
underestimating spam (2014: above 70% of all emails sent, 2021: above
45% of all emails sent).

** Practice - course infrastructure

*Useful:* take notes! Practice leads to mastery and the practice
exercises will often come back to haunt you in the tests.

1) Open a browser
2) Find the GitHub repos (birkenkrahe/dviz and /org)
3) Open the command line terminal
4) Open/close R
5) Open Emacs
6) Find the Emacs tutorial
7) Open/close R inside Emacs
8) Run R in an Org-mode file
9) Close Emacs
10) Close the command line terminal

- What's a serious limitation of statistics?
- What are "measures of center"? Which ones do you know?
- What are "measures of spread?" Which ones do you know?

#+begin_notes
- *Limitation of statistics:* cannot be used to find out *why*
  relationships exist, i.e. does not establish causation
- *Measures of center:* summarize data
  + mean or average
  + median or middle value
  + mode or most frequent value
- *Measures of spread:* indicate variety or clustering
  + range or min/max distance
  + variance or average distance from mean
  + standard deviation or square root of variance

#+begin_notes
Figure: "Adjusted odds ratios for confirmed cases of covid-19 by
interval after vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 before 4
January 2021 in those aged 80 years and older".

"Odds ratios are used to compare the relative odds of the occurrence
of the outcome of interest (e.g. disease or disorder), given
exposure to the variable of interest (e.g. health characteristic,
aspect of medical history). The odds ratio can also be used to
determine whether a particular exposure is a risk factor for a
particular outcome, and to compare the magnitude of various risk
factors for that outcome:
- OR=1 Exposure does not affect odds of outcome
- OR>1 Exposure associated with higher odds of outcome
- OR<1 Exposure associated with lower odds of outcome"

** Recap and exercise: data frames

- [ ] R functions:
  + ~data.frame~ - table, column vectors (like SQL)
  + ~c~ - creating vectors, concatenation
  + ~factor~ - vectors that hold categorical variables
  + ~str~ - structure of any R object
  + ~$~, ~[]~ - indexing operators
  + *NEW*: [[file:3_raw_data.org][subset]]

- Test questions:
  + How can you extract a vector named ~bar~ from a data frame named ~foo~? R command: ~foo$bar~
  + How can you extract elements with multiple conditions?
  + How can you find out how many rows and columns a data frame has?

  #+begin_notes
  1) ~foo$bar~ - if you know the column number ~N~: ~foo[,N]~,
     e.g. ~mtcars[,1]~ for the ~mpg~ column (~N=1~).
  2) By using logical expressions
  3) ~dim~, ~nrow~ x ~ncol~, ~str~
  #+end_notes
  #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
    ## head(mtcars)
    mtcars$mpg
    mtcars[,1]

| Weight in lbs.                                             | numeric-continuous  |
| Number of apples on a tree                                 | numeric-discrete    |
| Seniority ("freshman", "junior", "sophomore", "senior")    | categorical-ordinal |
| Employment status ("full-time", "part-time", "unemployed") | categorical-nominal |

*** History of probability and statistics

Match the dominant way of finding out truth, and the historical
period.

| WORLD-VIEW                          | PERIOD            |
|-------------------------------------+-------------------|
| Truth is in logic and numbers       | Classical period  |
| Truth lies in meditation and in God | Medieval period   |
| Truth is found through experiment   | Modern period     |
| Truth is constructed by man         | Postmodern period |

*** Data frame value extraction

~df~ is a data frame with four variables: ~person~, ~age~ in years, ~sex~ (~M~
or ~F~), and ~height~ in cm. Complete the R command to extract the persons
who are taller than 180 cm.

#+begin_example R
  df$___ [ df$___ > 180]
#+end_example

- [X] ~person~ ~height~
- [ ] ~height~ ~person~
- [ ] ~persons~ ~height~

- [ ] How Emacs, Org-mode and ESS work together
- [ ] Review test 3 - summary statistics
- [ ] Review 1st sprint review - "pride comes before the fall"
- [ ] Practice: data frames

** DONE [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-do-emacs--org-mode--ess-work-work-together][How Emacs, Org-mode and ESS work together]]
#+attr_html: :width 600px

** DONE Review test 3 - summary statistics
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/boxplot1.png]]

1) What are descriptive vs. inferential statistics? (83%)
2) What are the limitations of statistics? (67%)
3) Which plots visualize measures of spread? (50%)

On (2): check Judeah Pearl's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Why]["Book of Why"]]
** DONE Review: 1st sprint review
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/1_scrum.png]]

*** "Pride"

- Pride according to the Oxford dictionary:
  #+begin_quote
  »A feeling of being pleased or satisfied that you get when you or
  people who are connected with you have *done something well* or *own
  something* that other people *admire*.«
  #+end_quote
  In other words: if you cannot identify what you're proud of, you either haven't done anything well, or you're not aware of it, which won't do.

- Of course, /"pride comes before the fall"/ (Proverbs 16:18), but in
  the context of Scrum, it is only one of several qualities to assess
  the results of a sprint.

*** "References"
#+attr_html: :width 600px
[[../img/litref.png]]

- Some of you mentioned references, few provided any
- To do this week: Literature Review with [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/pdf/LitReview.pdf][cheat sheet]].
- [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/research/LitReview.docx][Download it from GitHub]], find at least 5 references, label them
  according to the categories (esp. relevance and credibility), and
  provide a complete, consistent set of citations.

*** "Questions"
#+attr_html: :width 600px
[[../img/meeting.jpg]]

- You should always use an opportunity to ask the customer/product
  owner anything, even if it's something simple. (*Why?*)

- Good question are specific, open (not closed as in yes/no), and use
  the qualities (as in: variables!) that you're after, e.g. "What do
  you like about me in terms of punctuality, systematic work,
  appearance..."

- A question is specific if you can immediately use it to take an
  action!

*Only one team asked questions at all (Nikkolette/Wyatt):*
- /What was the hardest part so far for you?/
- /What was the most interesting part you have found/want to find?/

*** Better next time!

[[../img/mountain.jpg]]

1) Deliver more than the bare minimum *generously*
2) Try to make your project great by working *systematically*
3) If you have a team, split up the work *meaningfully*
4) If you have any questions, ask others and me *bravely*
5) Complete the (optional) literature review *diligently*

** DONE Practice: raw data stats (30 min)

- I support some but not all recommendations:
  1) "Build skills with low-pressure projects" (i.e. play around)
  2) Don't worry about style but worry about documentation
  3) "Join the R community" - [[https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/figure?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010372.g002][I also use Twitter]]
  4) "Read others' code, and share yours" - use GitHub
  5) "Don't box yourself in" - use languages for what they're good at

** Review: test 4 - raw data, probability and stats

- [X] Longitude/latitude are what kind of data?
- [X] When researching, do you always need a "literature review"?
  - "Literature review" as a type of paper is the most useful
    paper you can find as a beginner - look for one in your
    project area!
- [X] Which activities connect "population" and "sample"?

** Review: probability and distributions (DataCamp)

1) What is the conditional probability for an event B given that an
   event A has already happened (as a formula)
   #+begin_notes
   Formula: P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)
   #+end_notes

2) How can you visualize the conditional probability formula for
   events A and B?

   #+begin_notes
   Example: A = Order for kitchen products, B = Orders over $150
   #+attr_html: :width 500px
   [[../img/kitchen1.png]]
   #+end_notes

3) A men's soccer team plays soccer zero, one, or two days a week:
   - the probability that they play zero days is .2,
   - the probability that they play one day is .5, and
   - the probability that they play two days is .3.

     What is the long-term average or expected value, μ, of the number
     of days per week that the men's soccer team plays soccer?

   #+begin_notes
   | x = DAYS | P(x) |
   |----------+------|
   |        0 |  0.2 |
   |        1 |  0.5 |
   |        2 |  0.3 |

   Expected value:
   E(DAYS) = μ = ∑ x P(x) = 0 * 0.2 + 1 * .5 + 2 * .3 = 1.1
   #+end_notes

   #+begin_src R
     ## number of days the team plays per week
     x <- c(0,1,2)  # events
     p_x <- c(0.2, 0.5, 0.3) # probability per event
     mu <- sum(x * p_x) # expected value
     paste("expected value: ", mu)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : expected value:  1.1

4) What is the /law of large numbers/?

   #+begin_notes
   As the size of your sample increases, the sample mean will
   approach the expected value (the population average).
   #+end_notes

   #+begin_src R :file ../img/sample.png :results output graphics file
     x <- sample(rep(1:6),size=10,replace=TRUE)
     hist(x, xlab="10 rolls, fair dice", main="die roll")
     abline(v = mean(x), col="red",lwd=2)
     abline(v = sum(x/6),col="blue",lwd=2)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:../img/sample.png]]

5) What is the probability that a baby will be born between midnight
   and 8 am? (If all hours are equally probable.)

   #+begin_notes
   A day has 24 hours - midnight to 8 am is 8/24 or 1/3, so 33%.
   #+end_notes

  "The scientists took a data-driven approach. They gathered data on all
  the organelle DNA that has been sequenced across life. They then used
  modeling, biochemistry, and structural biology to represent a wide
  range of different hypotheses about gene retention as a set of numbers
  associated with each gene. Using tools from data science and

  retained genes in the data they had compiled—testing the results with

#+begin_notes
One of the most influential statisticians of the 20th century, John
Wilder Tukey (1915–2000), played a key role in both the development
and study of statistics. A prolific writer, his collected papers
amount to eight volumes of work. Beyond his scientific work, his
collection reveals two hobbies: reading pulp mysteries and science
fiction, and square dancing. The above carefully posed picture shows
his lighter side: sampled data comes in one ear and goes out the
other, regularized. ([[https://www.amphilsoc.org/item-detail/photograph-john-wilder-tukey][Source]])

#+begin_quote
Dear students! I've looked at your sprint review reports. Some are
good, others are not so good, and a few are *missing* altogether.

We'll spend tomorrow's session reviewing the status of your results so
far, especially your *methods*. Please be prepared to *present* your
review in person (5 min) followed by a short *discussion* (5 min). That
is, you get my comments orally rather than in writing.

Please make sure you have *questions* not just for the other teams but
also for me.

If your topic is shared across different courses, make sure that you
are able to explain how exactly your research question / method /
results / presentation are going to *differ* from one course to the
next.

If you did not submit a separate *literature review* (only 2 teams did
that) including data and other secondary sources, please make sure you
are able to *cite* your references.
#+end_quote

1) Why sprint reviews?
   - meet and talk to the customer
   - check progress
   - prevent procrastination
   - manage your time

2) What's the most important aspect?
   - getting feedback from the customer (product owner)
   - present your prototype
   - check in with other teams

3) What comes after the sprint review?
   - reflect on what you learnt from the sprint review
   - prepare for the next sprint

4) How do you feel about sprint reviews?
   - I feel nothing
   - I am worry
   - I feel good about (it pushes me along)
   - I sometimes feel demotivated because of the progress of others

** Review: Tukey's Five-Point Stats Summary
#+attr_html: :width 300px
[[../img/review.jpg]]

1) The data set ~ToothGrowth~ contains the variable ~supp~ that indicates
   if a guinea pig was fed orange juice or vitamin C. How would you
   /compute Tukey's 5-point summary/ in R and what results do you expect?
   #+begin_src R
     summary(ToothGrowth$supp)
     length(ToothGrowth$supp)/2
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : OJ VC
   : 30 30
   : [1] 30

2) A data scientist runs the code below on the ~faithful~ data set of
   the ~MASS~ package. What is this data scientist likely /interested in/?
   #+begin_src R
     index <- faithful$eruptions > 4
     mean(faithful$waiting[index])
   #+end_src
   #+begin_notes
   The data scientist wanted to know how long he'd have to wait on
   average for an eruption of more than 4 minutes length of the Old
   Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park.
   #+end_notes

3) What would be a good /title/ for the plot below?
   #+begin_src R :file ../img/geyser.png :results graphics file
     index <- faithful$eruptions > 4
     y <- faithful$waiting[index]
     boxplot(y,
             data=faithful,
             horizontal=TRUE)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:../img/geyser.png]]

   #+begin_src R :file ../img/geyser1.png :results graphics file
     boxplot(y,
             data=faithful,
             horizontal=TRUE,
             main = "Summary of Old Faithful eruption time > 4 min",
             xlab = "Waiting time in minutes")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:../img/geyser1.png]]

4) Finally , let's look at the 5-point summary for these data
   #+begin_src R
     summary(faithful$waiting[index])
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   :    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
   :   69.00   77.00   81.00   81.02   84.00   96.00

** Example: Basketball players

- Here is a diagram for two basketball players A and B:
  1) What kind of diagram is this?
  2) What is plotted here exactly?
  3) How many observations were made?
  4) Is the average score a good measure to compare the players?
  5) What drives the length of the whiskers?
  6) If you had to choose between having player A or player B on the
     team, which one would you pick and why?
  #+attr_html: :width 500px
  [[../img/basketball.png]]
  #+begin_notes
  1) The diagram contains two boxplots, also called box-and-whisker
     diagrams.
  2) Plotted are ~Score~ - a numeric-discrete counter variable, and
     ~Player~ - a categorical-nominal variable.
  3) The plot does not contain this information!
  4) The mean is influenced by the sample size and variability. For
     larger samples, the mean and the median generally converge. We
     don't know anything about the sample size. The average score of
     Player B is distorted by the great variability of the score,
     therefore the average score is not a good basis of comparison.
  5) The length of the whiskers indicates variability outside of the
     lower and upper quartiles (the data smaller than 25% and larger
     than 75% of the data).
     #+attr_html: :width 500px
     [[../img/boxplotdiagram.jpg]]
  6) Player A has a relatively small range (difference between maximum
     and minimum sample value), and his median score is a little
     higher. Player B has a very large range - he sometimes scores a
     lot higher, but sometimes a lot lower. We pick player A because
     he plays more consistently and usually scores higher than B.

* Week 10: Review measures of spread
#+attr_html: :width 450px
[[../img/milgram.jpg]]

- [X] Current assignments ([[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/655/discussion_topics/968][Canvas]])
- [X] Review: measures of spread
- [X] The power (and weakness) of correlations
- [ ] Covariance/correlation - variables changing in concert
- [ ] Outliers - values who "don't fit the narrative"

** Review: measures of spread

*Think about your answer or compute in R*

1) Which measure of centrality corresponds to the IQR?
   #+begin_quote
   The median is the corresponding measure of central tendency.
   #+end_quote

2) Is the IQR more or less robust as a measure of spread than the
   standard deviation?
   #+begin_quote
   The IQR is more robust against outliers than the standard deviation
   because the latter is defined as average distance from the mean or
   sample average, which is more vulnerable against outliers.
   #+end_quote

3) Use ~tapply~ to compute the interquartile range of the ~len~ variable
   of the pre-loaded ~ToothGrowth~ data set for both values of ~supp~.
   #+begin_src R
     tapply(X=ToothGrowth$len, INDEX=ToothGrowth$supp, FUN=IQR)
   #+end_src

4) How would you compute the IQR of ~len~ for both values of ~supp~
   without ~tapply~?
   #+begin_src R
     IQR(ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$supp=="OJ"])
     IQR(ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$supp=="VC"])
   #+end_src

5) What does this result mean in practice?
   #+begin_quote
   - The IQR is the "spread of the middle 50% of all values", or the
     width/height of the horizontal/vertical box plot.
   - The middle 50% of all length measurements recorded in ~len~ is
     slightly larger for a supply of vitamin C than orange juice.
   - The teeth of Guinea pigs fed with vitamin C instead of orange
     juice show a slightly greater spread of recorded tooth length.
   #+end_quote

6) How would you create a box-and-whiskers (aka box plot) plot for
   both values of ~supp~?
   #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file ../img/supp.png :exports both
     supply <- ToothGrowth$supp
     tg_len <- ToothGrowth$len
     boxplot(
       tg_len[supply=="OJ"],
       tg_len[supply=="VC"],
       horizontal=TRUE,
       names=c("Orange Juice", "Vitamin C"),
       main="len in data set ToothGrowth")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:../img/supp.png]]

** "Cutting through the crap" with ~cut~

Preview of assignment 7: using ~cut~ to create categories from a numeric
variable:

- You can use ~tapply~ to apply any function ~FUN~ to a data set ~X~ using a
  factor variable as the ~INDEX~

- With ~cut~, you can create such an ~INDEX~ factor vector from any
  numeric variable in your data set ~X~

- Example: the ~Nile~ data set

  1. Check the range of values and choose breaks
     #+begin_src R
       min(Nile)
       max(Nile)
       seq(456,1370,by=100)
     #+end_src
  2. Use ~cut~ to define new categories
     #+begin_src R
       nilecat <- cut(x=Nile,
                      breaks=
                        seq(from=456, to=1370, by=200),
                      right=F,
                      include.lowest=TRUE)
       levels(nilecat)
     #+end_src
  3. Use ~tapply~ to split the data set according to the ~nilecat~
     categories and compute the sample mean and standard deviation
     on each segment:
     #+begin_src R :results silent
       avg <- tapply(X=Nile, INDEX=nilecat, FUN=mean)
       std <- tapply(X=Nile, INDEX=nilecat, FUN=sd)
     #+end_src
  4. Plot the results with ~plot~ and write the result to ~nilecat.png~
     #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file ../img/nilecat.png
       par(mfrow=c(2,1), pty='s')
       barplot(avg,horiz=TRUE,cex.names=0.7,las=1, col="steelblue")

** 3rd sprint review - write an abstract

Here is an example from my current publication project - you're the
research participants!

Your abstract should have no more than 300 words. My example has 350
words (with many references still missing) and could easily be pruned
to 300. [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/research/Abstract.org][The full abstract (work in progress) is here]].

1) "One or two sentences providing a basic *introduction* to the field,
   comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline."

   #+begin_quote
   Data science draws on computer science, statistics and domain
   knowledge. It is highly *interdisciplinary*, even more so than other
   related fields like business intelligence or artificial
   intelligence. This interdisciplinarity leads to its alleged
   'sexyness' (Davenport/Patil, 2012 and 2022) - it purports to be
   open to students from a wide variety of backgrounds - like biology
   or psychology, who are interested in widely different
   applications - like genome analysis or marketing predictions (???).
   #+end_quote

2) "Two or three sentences of more detailed *background*, comprehensive
   to scientists in related disciplines."

   #+begin_quote
   This versatility comes at a price: the beginner's learning path in
   data science is highly fragmented - it involves different
   programming languages, data visualization techniques, mathematical
   and process modeling, and knowledge of computing infrastructure
   (???).
   #+end_quote

3) "One sentence clearly stating the general *problem* being addressed
   by this particular study." (And how it was addressed = method.)

   #+begin_quote
   The problem is how to get enough of an overview of all of these
   aspects while learning about data science to solve real-world
   problems, especially for absolute beginners of data science
   (???). For this study, I have employed the (in computer science
   terms) ancient art of literate programming for instruction,
   interaction, and immersion in data science. To facilitate this
   triade of methods, the equally ancient text editor GNU Emacs with
   the ESS ('Emacs Speaks Statistics') and Org-mode plugins were used.
   #+end_quote

4) "Two or three sentences explaining what the main *result* reveals in
   direct comparison to what was thought to be the case previously, or
   how the main result adds to previous knowledge."

   #+begin_quote
   Data science teaching practice has focused on creating special
   tools like RStudio, a popular IDE for R, packages like the
   "Tidyverse", or online platforms like DataCamp to make learning
   data science (in this case via an R programming track) more
   palatable. Unfortunately, these parallel infrastructures achieve
   little when it comes to preparing students for the real world
   (???). The methodological attitude is well summarized by the "low
   code/no code" trend in IT (???).
   #+end_quote

5) "One or two sentences to put the results in a broader context."

   #+begin_quote
   We have used these methods for two consecutive terms across a
   spectrum of courses, with undergraduate students of varying
   seniority, background and interests at a small liberal arts
   college. The results were very encouraging, and contradict the
   current "no code/low code" trend in IT. In stark contrast, the
   study demonstrates that a "high road" approach mixing tools that
   are considered to be difficult but that deliver deep insights into
   both computing infrastructure and data processing, might be at
   least as successful if not more successful. Only followup studies
   can show if this hope will pan out.

"How the 1961 Milgram Experiment Showed That Everyday People Could
Commit Monstrous Acts"
#+end_quote

- [ ] Participants: 40 middle-class white US American males, aged
  40-50.

- [ ] What do you think: "Do situational variables play a larger
  factor than personality types when determining obedience?"

- [ ] Put more simply: can people be made to do anything, no matter
  how monstrous? What is the evidence? What about yourself?

- [ ] Limitations: which aspects of ethical decisions are missing from
  the experiment and from its standard interpretation? Which other
  limitations can you think of?

- [ ] Relevance: which real life situations do you know where
  obedience plays a role?

- *Discuss with your neighbor(s) and prepare short statements*

#+begin_notes
- Some limitations include: sample bias, time pressure, fake setup -
  the use of deception:
  1) The sample consisted of 40 male participants aged between 40-50,
     middle class, white American citizens
  2) Time pressure on the participants
  3) Use of deception
  4) Time dependency: participants in their 40-50s in 1960 were 20-30
     in the 1940s = had lived through WWII as adults - does a war make
     you more or less obedient?
  5) Lack of ecological validity - test was carried out in an
     artificial lab environment and cannot per se be generalized to
     real life obedience such as in the Holocaust

- Missing aspects: e.g. faith as the basis of ethical decisions. Along
  the lines of behavioral psychology, people are reduced to bio
  feedback machines (mechanistic/posititvist model of humans). Even
  without faith, allowances might have to be made for yet undiscovered
  aspects of the human psyche - perhaps there is an "ethics brain
  section" that looks different for different people?

- How often does it happen that people want to believe a story so much
  that they're willing to overlook the limitations of experiments? Can
  you think of examples?

** Discussion results

1) Can people be made to do anything no matter how monstrous?
   - Right set of situational variables, then yes
   - Not because some situations are too personal or extreme

2) What is the evidence?

3) Personal experience or views?

4) What are some limitations of this experiment?
   - Setup is not real: strangers, story dependency, deception
   - Sample is extremely narrow (changing demographics)

5) Which real life situations do you know to which this experiment
   might apply?
   - Autonomous cars
   - Pandemic - masks and vaccination

** DataCamp review: the binomial distribution

*Some of these questions may show up in the tests/final exam*

*Get the file from [[https://tinyurl.com/mr77ned7][tinyurl.com/mr77ned7]] to code/note along*

1) What is the main message of this lesson?

   - probability simulation vs. exact computation

   - generating data from a probability distribution, in this   case ~X = Binomial(size,p)~

2) What is "inference" vs. "probability"? Why is this important?

   - inference \equiv from observed sample data to model to predict truths about a population

   - probability \equiv from stochastic model to sample data to predict the future

3) What is a coin flip before you look at the outcome?

   - random variable (not fixed?)

4) What is a coin flip once you've looked at the outcome?

   - event that can be observed and recorded => sample

5) What are the possible outcomes of ~rbinom(1,1,0.5)~?

   Outcome = 0 or 1 for heads or tails of flipping a fair coin
   #+begin_src R
     rbinom(n = 1, # number of coin flips = vector length
            size = 1, # number of coins = sample size
            prob = 0.5) # probability of "heads"
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] 0

6) What are the possible outcomes of ~rbinom(1,10,0.5)~?

   Number of heads when flipping 10 fair coins at once
   #+begin_src R
     rbinom(1,10,0.5)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] 4

7) What are the possible outcomes of ~rbinom(10,10,0.5)~?

   #+begin_src R
     rbinom(10,10,0.5)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   :  [1] 4 5 9 7 5 8 4 7 4 1

8) What data structure is ~rbinom~? What about ~rbinom(1,1,0.5)~?

   #+begin_src R
     str(rbinom)
     class(rbinom)
     is.vector(rbinom(1,1,0.5))
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : function (n, size, prob)
   : [1] "function"
   : [1] TRUE

9) What is an 'unfair' coin? How is this simulated in R?

   - Coin is unfairly weighted
   - Flipping probability is no longer exactly 50%
   #+begin_src R
     rbinom(10,1,0.05)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   :  [1] 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0

10) What does "coin flip with probability 25%" mean? How to show this?

    - only 25% of the flips are expected to be 'heads'
    #+begin_src R
      flips <- rbinom(n=100000,
                      size=1,
                      prob=0.25)
      mean(flips)
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : [1] 0.25013

11) Which plot type is used to visualize many coin flips?

    - A histogram, which plots counts/frequency of events against the event category - for 10 coins N \in {0,...10}
    - The result visualizes a distribution of probabilities

12) Plot 100,000 simultaneous flips of 10 fair coins!

    #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file histogram.png
      flips <- rbinom(100000, 10, .5) # N=10^5, 10 fair coins
      hist(flips,
           main="100,000 flips of 10 fair coins",
           xlab="Number of heads",
           ylab="Flip count")
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    [[file:histogram.png]]

13) How can you inspect the frequencies without plotting them?

    #+begin_src R
      table(flips)
      names(table(flips))
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : flips
    :     0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10
    :    99   981  4408 11634 20543 24670 20522 11741  4343   970    89
    :  [1] "0"  "1"  "2"  "3"  "4"  "5"  "6"  "7"  "8"  "9"  "10"

    Create a barplot of this simulation:
    #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file barplot.png
      barplot(table(rbinom(10,1,0.5)),
              main="10 flips of 1 fair coins",
              xlab="Number of heads",
              ylab="Flip count")
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    [[file:barplot.png]]

14) What is the simulated density of the binomial distribution at ~X=5~?

    Density expresses "compactness" of our data
    #+begin_src R
      flips <- rbinom(100000,10,0.5)
      mean(flips==5)
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : [1] 0.24642

15) What is the exact binomial probability density at ~X=5~?

    Prob of getting 5 heads when flipping 10 fair coins
    #+begin_src R
      dbinom(x = 5, size = 10, prob = 0.5)  # Pr(X=5)
      mean(rbinom(100000,10,0.5) == 5) # simulation result
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : [1] 0.2460938
    : [1] 0.24722

16) What is cumulative density? How do you simulate/compute it?

    Probability of geting less or equal than 4 heads Pr(X\le4)
    #+begin_src R
      pbinom(4,10,0.5)
    #+end_src

17) What is the relationship between ~Pr(X \ge 5)~ and ~Pr(X < 4)~?

    #+begin_src R
      1 - pbinom(4,10,0.5)
      pbinom(4,10,0.5)
      1 - pbinom(4,10,0.5) + pbinom(4,10,0.5)
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : [1] 0.6230469
    : [1] 0.3769531
    : [1] 1

18) What's the relationship between sample average and expected
    value?

19) What's the formula for the expected value, and how does it relate
    to the definition of the ~binom~ family of functions?

20) What's the definition of the variance of a distribution?

*Selection of quiz questions (__/120) from the final exam (40/120):*

1) What are mutually exclusive events? What's an example? How could
   you show this using a Monte Carlo simulation?
   #+begin_notes
   If A and B are mutually exclusive, then ~Pr(A \cap B) = 0~, and
   in R: ~intersect(A,B)=0~
   #+end_notes

2) What probability does this Venn diagram represent if A and B are
   events? Answer in terms of set theory, probability and stochastics.
   #+attr_html: :width 300px
   [[../img/7_complement.png]]
   #+begin_notes
   - The complement of Pr(A) [set theory = state space]
   - The probability 1 - Pr(A) [probability theory = prediction]
   - The probability that A will not occur [stochastics = [process]
   #+end_notes

3) When can you smooth a density plot (and what does the "smoothing" represent)?
   #+attr_html: :width 300px
   [[../img/entryquiz_density.png]]
   #+begin_notes
    - Smoothing means making assumptions about the underlying
      distribution and drawing a curve accordingly
    - Smoothing accuracy depends on the underlying data set.
    - In R, ~density~ achieves this using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
    - Used in digital recording, sampling, voice recognition etc.
   #+end_notes
   #+begin_src R :results silent
     par(mfrow=c(1,1))
     hist(Nile, col="lightblue",las=1)
     par(new=TRUE)
     lines(plot(density(Nile),
                col="red", lwd=2,
                main="",xlab="",ylab="", # remove axis labels
                axes="n"))
    #+end_src   

4) What is agile project management? Do you know an example method?
   What's agile about the processes of the example? What has this to
   do with applied math?
   #+begin_notes
      - Agility with regard to deadlines and deliverables
      - Focus on customer contact and feedback
      - Example methods: Kanban (board), Scrum (sprints)
      [[../img/kanban.png]]
      - Applied math: application of mathematics to real-world
        problems implies that there is a customer=beneficiary
      #+end_notes

   - What type of variable is ~Sex~?
   - How can I plot ~Sex~ as a bar chart? (2 ways)
   #+begin_src R
     df <- read.csv(file="../data/dataset.csv",header=TRUE)
     str(df)
     df$Name[df$Height > 180]
     str(df$Sex) # character, categorical variable
     barplot(table(df$Sex)) # bar chart from frequency table
     plot(factor(df$Sex)) # bar chart from factor levels
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
