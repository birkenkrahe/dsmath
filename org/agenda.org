* README

- DSC 482 focuses on statistics, probability and distributions
- We use R as a language, GNU Emacs as editor, ESS as statistics
  extension, and Org-mode for literate programming
- For details on objectives, audience, grading, schedule, check the
  [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/blob/main/org/syllabus.org][syllabus]] or the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org][FAQ]] on GitHub.
- This file contains a (dynamically updated) agenda for each session
  as well as some content.
- You can also look at [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/blob/main/org/agenda.org][the agenda on GitHub]].

#+begin_quote
In DSC 482/MTH 445 (Applied maths for data science), I do NOT assume
familiarity with R. We will learn the language as we go along. This
will necessarily slow us down but this is a math/computing course, so
concepts (in this case probability/statistics) are as important as
coding. Textbook: Book of R, Part III (ch. 13-16), by T D Davies
(NoStarch, 2016).
#+end_quote

- General preparation: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-can-i-prepare-for-your-data-science-classes][see the FAQ]] - R, Emacs + ESS + Org-mode

#+begin_notes
Bill Gates committed what is called a statistical "Type II" error,
when in 2004, he said "Two years from now, spam will be solved." Not
rejecting this null hypothesis by Microsoft, arguably lead to
underestimating spam (2014: above 70% of all emails sent, 2021: above
45% of all emails sent).

** Quick entry test analysis

#+begin_src R :results output graphics file :file ../img/entry_hist.png
  results <- c(10.67, 9.67, 13.83, 7.83, 7.17, 11.67, 11.67, 10.83, 9.67, 11.67, 14.42)
  hist_results <- hist(results)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:../img/entry_hist.png]]

#+begin_src R :results output graphics file :file ../img/entry_dens.png
  results <- c(10.67, 9.67, 13.83, 7.83, 7.17, 11.67, 11.67, 10.83, 9.67, 11.67, 14.42)
  plot(density(results))

** Practice - course infrastructure

*Useful:* take notes! Practice leads to mastery and the practice
exercises will often come back to haunt you in the tests.

1) Open a browser
2) Find the GitHub repos (birkenkrahe/dviz and /org)
3) Open the command line terminal
4) Open/close R
5) Open Emacs
6) Find the Emacs tutorial
7) Open/close R inside Emacs
8) Run R in an Org-mode file
9) Close Emacs
10) Close the command line terminal

*Note:* Class room practice completion = 10 points each for active
participation.

** Home assignments - how they work
#+attr_html: :width 400px
#+captions: course infrastructure
[[../img/platforms.png]]

- Assignment must be completed on time on [[https://app.datacamp.com/groups/lyon-college-data-science-fall-2022/assignments][DataCamp]]
- Assignment is posted on [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/655/assignments][Canvas]] (includes the link)
- You loose 1 point for every day of late submission
- Canvas Gradebook is updated manually (with some delay)

** Getting started with projects

- Course has 14 participants!

- You'll have to do the project in a team - 2 to 3 people

- We can only accommodate at most 8 projects (last week of term)

- Put your team/ideas into this table ([[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/655/pages/enter-your-project-ideas-and-team-here][Canvas]]) by Thursday

- [X] *Who has not yet found a team?*

- [X] *Who has a team but no idea what to do?*

- Reminder: plenty of project opportunities ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/blob/main/org/1_overview.org#many-project-opportunities][overview]] / GitHub [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/issues][issues]])

** Featured example
#+attr_html: :width 400px
#+caption: text prompt = an armchair in the shape of an avocado.
[[../img/avocado.png]]

- GitHub issue: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/issues/25][DALL-E math]]

- Source: [[https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/][OpenAI - creating images from text]])

- DALL-E is a so-called transformer language model ([[https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/posts/dalle2/][explanation]])

- Your project could consist in trying to understand what it is about,
  place it in context, perhaps clarify some of the math, and relate
  this to the class

- [[https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/][Avocado example]] and others

** Group exercise: orientation

Figure: web page "performance". These are statistics that use summary
statistics (e.g. averages) but otherwise they are closely tied to the
domain of web traffic monitoring (or SEO - Search Engine Optimization)
in order to increase Click-Through-Rate (CTR).

- What's a serious limitation of statistics?
- What are "measures of center"? Which ones do you know?
- What are "measures of spread?" Which ones do you know?

#+begin_notes
- *Limitation of statistics:* cannot be used to find out *why*
  relationships exist, i.e. does not establish causation
- *Measures of center:* summarize data
  + mean or average
  + median or middle value
  + mode or most frequent value
- *Measures of spread:* indicate variety or clustering
  + range or min/max distance
  + variance or average distance from mean
  + standard deviation or square root of variance

#+begin_notes
Figure: "Adjusted odds ratios for confirmed cases of covid-19 by
interval after vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 before 4
January 2021 in those aged 80 years and older".

"Odds ratios are used to compare the relative odds of the occurrence
of the outcome of interest (e.g. disease or disorder), given
exposure to the variable of interest (e.g. health characteristic,
aspect of medical history). The odds ratio can also be used to
determine whether a particular exposure is a risk factor for a
particular outcome, and to compare the magnitude of various risk
factors for that outcome:
- OR=1 Exposure does not affect odds of outcome
- OR>1 Exposure associated with higher odds of outcome
- OR<1 Exposure associated with lower odds of outcome"

* DONE Recap and exercise: data frames

- [ ] R functions:
  + ~data.frame~ - table, column vectors (like SQL)
  + ~c~ - creating vectors, concatenation
  + ~factor~ - vectors that hold categorical variables
  + ~str~ - structure of any R object
  + ~$~, ~[]~ - indexing operators
  + *NEW*: [[file:3_raw_data.org][subset]]

- Test questions:
  + How can you extract a vector named ~bar~ from a data frame named ~foo~? R command: ~foo$bar~
  + How can you extract elements with multiple conditions?
  + How can you find out how many rows and columns a data frame has?

  #+begin_notes
  1) ~foo$bar~ - if you know the column number ~N~: ~foo[,N]~,
     e.g. ~mtcars[,1]~ for the ~mpg~ column (~N=1~).
  2) By using logical expressions
  3) ~dim~, ~nrow~ x ~ncol~, ~str~
  #+end_notes
  #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
    ## head(mtcars)
    mtcars$mpg
    mtcars[,1]
  #+end_src

** Match the statistical variable type and the variable.

| VARIABLE                                                   | TYPE                |
|------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------|
| Weight in lbs.                                             | numeric-continuous  |
| Number of apples on a tree                                 | numeric-discrete    |
| Seniority ("freshman", "junior", "sophomore", "senior")    | categorical-ordinal |
| Employment status ("full-time", "part-time", "unemployed") | categorical-nominal |
 
** History of probability and statistics

Match the dominant way of finding out truth, and the historical
period.

| WORLD-VIEW                          | PERIOD            |
|-------------------------------------+-------------------|
| Truth is in logic and numbers       | Classical period  |
| Truth lies in meditation and in God | Medieval period   |
| Truth is found through experiment   | Modern period     |
| Truth is constructed by man         | Postmodern period |

** Data frame value extraction

~df~ is a data frame with four variables: ~person~, ~age~ in years, ~sex~ (~M~
or ~F~), and ~height~ in cm. Complete the R command to extract the persons
who are taller than 180 cm. 

#+begin_example R
  df$___ [ df$___ > 180]  
#+end_example

 - [X] ~person~ ~height~
 - [ ] ~height~ ~person~
 - [ ] ~persons~ ~height~
 - [ ] ~sex~ ~height~ 

*** Solution

#+name: extract
#+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
  df <- data.frame (
    person = c("Peter", "Lois", "Meg", "Chris", "Stewie"),
    age = c(42, 40, 17, 14, 1),
    sex = factor(c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")),
    height = c(182, 177, 168, 179, 187))
