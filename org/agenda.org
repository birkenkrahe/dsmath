* README

- DSC 482 focuses on statistics, probability and distributions
- We use R as a language, GNU Emacs as editor, ESS as statistics
  extension, and Org-mode for literate programming
- For details on objectives, audience, grading, schedule, check the
  [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/blob/main/org/syllabus.org][syllabus]] or the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org][FAQ]] on GitHub.
- This file contains a (dynamically updated) agenda for each session
  as well as some content.
- You can also look at [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/blob/main/org/agenda.org][the agenda on GitHub]].

- First place to go to with a general question
- FAQ is regularly updated with new content

#+begin_quote
In DSC 482/MTH 445 (Applied maths for data science), I do NOT assume
familiarity with R. We will learn the language as we go along. This
will necessarily slow us down but this is a math/computing course, so
concepts (in this case probability/statistics) are as important as
coding. Textbook: Book of R, Part III (ch. 13-16), by T D Davies
(NoStarch, 2016).
#+end_quote

- General preparation: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-can-i-prepare-for-your-data-science-classes][see the FAQ]] - R, Emacs + ESS + Org-mode

#+begin_notes
Bill Gates committed what is called a statistical "Type II" error,
when in 2004, he said "Two years from now, spam will be solved." Not
rejecting this null hypothesis by Microsoft, arguably lead to
underestimating spam (2014: above 70% of all emails sent, 2021: above
45% of all emails sent).

** Quick entry test analysis

#+begin_src R :results output graphics file :file ../img/entry_hist.png
  results <- c(10.67, 9.67, 13.83, 7.83, 7.17, 11.67, 11.67, 10.83, 9.67, 11.67, 14.42)
  hist_results <- hist(results)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:../img/entry_hist.png]]

#+begin_src R :results output graphics file :file ../img/entry_dens.png
  results <- c(10.67, 9.67, 13.83, 7.83, 7.17, 11.67, 11.67, 10.83, 9.67, 11.67, 14.42)
  plot(density(results))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:../img/entry_dens.png]]

** Practice - course infrastructure

*Useful:* take notes! Practice leads to mastery and the practice
exercises will often come back to haunt you in the tests.

1) Open a browser
2) Find the GitHub repos (birkenkrahe/dviz and /org)
3) Open the command line terminal
4) Open/close R
5) Open Emacs
6) Find the Emacs tutorial
7) Open/close R inside Emacs
8) Run R in an Org-mode file
9) Close Emacs
10) Close the command line terminal

*Note:* Class room practice completion = 10 points each for active
participation.

* Week 2: getting started

- [X] Quiz 1: course infrastructure
- [X] About: home assignments
- [X] Getting started with projects
- [X] Group work: Data Science At The End Of Modern Time ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/blob/main/org/2_orientation_practice.org][GitHub]])
- [X] Lecture: Data Science At The End Of Modern Time
- [ ] Practice: Running R in an Emacs Org-mode file ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/blob/main/org/1_overview_practice.org#run-r-in-org-mode-file][GitHub]])
- [ ] Lectures: Describing raw data with statistical variables
- [ ] Practice: Raw data and statistical variables ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/blob/main/org/3_raw_data_practice.org][GitHub]])
- [ ] Home assignment: summary statistics ([[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-statistics][DataCamp]])

** Home assignments - how they work
#+attr_html: :width 400px
#+captions: course infrastructure
[[../img/platforms.png]]

- Assignment must be completed on time on [[https://app.datacamp.com/groups/lyon-college-data-science-fall-2022/assignments][DataCamp]]
- Assignment is posted on [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/655/assignments][Canvas]] (includes the link)
- You loose 1 point for every day of late submission
- Canvas Gradebook is updated manually (with some delay)

** Getting started with projects

- Course has 14 participants!

- You'll have to do the project in a team - 2 to 3 people

- We can only accommodate at most 8 projects (last week of term)

- Put your team/ideas into this table ([[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/655/pages/enter-your-project-ideas-and-team-here][Canvas]]) by Thursday

- [X] *Who has not yet found a team?*

- [X] *Who has a team but no idea what to do?*

- Reminder: plenty of project opportunities ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/blob/main/org/1_overview.org#many-project-opportunities][overview]] / GitHub [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/issues][issues]])

** Featured example  
#+attr_html: :width 400px
#+caption: text prompt = an armchair in the shape of an avocado.
[[../img/avocado.png]]

- GitHub issue: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/issues/25][DALL-E math]]

- Source: [[https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/][OpenAI - creating images from text]]) 

- DALL-E is a so-called transformer language model ([[https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/posts/dalle2/][explanation]])

- Your project could consist in trying to understand what it is about,
  place it in context, perhaps clarify some of the math, and relate
  this to the class

- [[https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/][Avocado example]] and others

"Probability is the most important concept in modern science,
especially as nobody has the slightest notion what it means."
