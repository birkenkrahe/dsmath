Cutting the Stone, also called The Extraction of the Stone of Madness,
or The Cure of Folly, is a painting by Hieronymous Bosch
from 1494. The painting depicts a surgeon, wearing a funnel hat,
removing the stone of madness from a patient's head by
trepanation. The stone (Dutch: /kei/) appears as a flower bulb. The
Gothic inscription reads: /Master, cut the stone out, fast. My name is
Lubbert Das/. (Source: Wikipedia)

#+begin_notes
Title: 'Our work has produced great answers. Now someone just needs to
figure out which questions they go with."  In statistics, a proxy
variable is used as a stand-in for one or more other variables that
are difficult to measure. In order to be useful as such, proxy
variables must be correlated with what they are intended to
represent. For example, a drug might aim to reduce deaths from a
slow-acting disease. But testing if it reduces deaths might take many
years, so researchers might test for a proxy outcome instead, like
whether it results in loss of bone density or damage to
cells. Physicians use blood pressure as one of many proxies for
cardiovascular health. Source: [[https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/2652:_Proxy_Variable][explanation]] (July 29, 2022)

* COURSE TOPICS (SPELLED OUT)
#+attr_html: :width 500px
#+caption: Pablo Picasso, Guernica (1937), grayscale painting
[[../img/1_guernica.png]]

1) Elementary statistics
2) Basic data visualization
3) Probability
4) Distributions
5) Linear regression

#+begin_notes
Guernica by Picasso (1937) depics the bombing on the Spanish city of
Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. It is also a typical
cubist-surrealist painting where reality is dissolved in geometric
patterns and symbols, distorted and disfigured to achieve a heightened
effect. Our upcoming discussion on the origins of statistics and
probability will make it clearer why I chose this image to illustrate
the list of topics.

* WHY "MATH FOR DATA SCIENCE"?
#+attr_html: :width 500px
#+caption: Joseph Wright of Derby: An Experiment on a Bird in an Air Pump (1768)
[[../img/1_experiment.jpg]]

- The central purpose of data science is /pattern identification/
- Patterns cannot usually be discerned directly from the data
- In experiments, data must be sampled and analyzed
- Data analysis is primarily a mathematical discipline
- Core: statistical summaries and probability distributions
- Alternative name: causal inferential statistics
- Distinct from: machine learning, big data (massive datasets)

  #+begin_notes
  "The painting departed from convention of the time by depicting a
  scientific subject in the reverential manner formerly reserved for
  scenes of historical or religious significance. Wright was
  intimately involved in depicting the Industrial Revolution and the
  scientific advances of the Enlightenment." (Source: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Experiment_on_a_Bird_in_the_Air_Pump][Wikipedia]])

* THE WHOLE DATA SCIENCE PIPELINE
#+attr_html: :width 500px
#+caption: Data science pipeline
[[../img/1_pipeline.png]]

- Math important for: data cleaning and data modeling
- Need to know: coding (R programming) and story (visualization)
- This course focuses on descriptive rather than predictive stats
- The followup course ("Machine learning") is about prediction
- Missing (among other things): measure theory (project?)[fn:4]

[fn:4]A measure assigns a probability to sets of events where each
individual event has zero probability so that expectations for
continuous random variables can be defined. [[https://youtu.be/Q9KOeP-nrYQ][This mini lecture]]
(Lawrence, 2012) from an advanced probability seminar addresses
answers the question why measure theory is needed here. 

[fn:3][[https://www.statmethods.net/advstats/timeseries.html][Time series]] is the example featured here, with important
applications in environmental science, finance, portfolio analysis

[fn:2]Both of these are commercial, but there are other languages and
platforms, e.g. Tableau (also featured on DataCamp), or GNU Octave.

[fn:1]This is a great package whose abilities will remind those of you
with SQL knowledge of the database course. To learn more about it, the
[[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-manipulation-with-datatable-in-r][DataCamp course]] is a good starting point.
