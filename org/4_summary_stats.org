returns the path searched by R to find packages

[fn:4]The ~head~ function prints 6 rows by default. To print only 5
rows, you need to restrict its range with ~head(x=chickwts,n=5)~

[fn:3] Recall that a data frame consists of vectors. It is created
with the ~data.frame~ function - its arguments are vectors of any
type. Numerical or character vectors are created with the ~c~
function. Its arguments are values of any one type - characters or
numbers. Factors are vectors, and they are created using the ~factor~
function. The difference is that their levels can be ordered
explicitly.

[fn:2]/You can get help on any of the examples with ~?~ or ~help()~.

[fn:1]This is the "3V" definition of big data. You'll find other
attributes, like "value" or "veracity", which are not directly
measurable, however.
